		<h3>About Me</h3>

			<p>My very first camera was given to me on my seventh birthday, where you only get one flash bulb and hope for the best. I became fasinated about photography, the experiences, and the magic it holds.</p>

			<p>My uncle, who owned his own photo store, upgraded me from point and shoot, to his old, manual, heavy camera, with fixed lenes, and a flash, as a present. It was in junior year of high school, where I started to photograph the environment around me, which was local punk shows, my surrounding neighborhoods, and my friends.</p>

			<p>In college, I spent my weekends in the darkroom, exploring with different chemicals, manipulations, film devlopment, and printing. It was a magical experience, to be in control, and learned to fail when film was not developed correctly, and all my memories of the present time, were earsed.</p>

			<p>Now I have the tools to have endless frames, but I try to be present how I was taught, just to be in one.</p>
