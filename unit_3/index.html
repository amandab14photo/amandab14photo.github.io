	<p>My very first camera was given to me on my seventh Birthday, where you only get one flash bulb and hope for the best. I became fasinated about photography, the experiences, and the magic it holds. 

	My uncle, upgraded me with his old camera, lenes, and a flash, as a present, since he owned his own camera store. It was then, I started to photograph my environment around me, which was local punk shows, my surrounding neighborhoods, and my friends. 

	In college, I spent my weekends in the darkroom, exploring with different chemicals, manipulations, film devlopment and printing. It was a magical experience, to be in control, or to fail when film was not developed correctly, and all my memories of the present time, were earsed.
